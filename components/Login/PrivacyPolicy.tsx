                    privacy as a critical community principle. We understand clearly that your information and your
                    trust is
                    one of our most important assets. If we ever change how we use your Information, we will notify you

                    well as technological security devices. </p>
                <p className={privacyDivs.paragraph}>We rely on third party service providers to support or provide

                    for us in connection with your
                    use of the Service, such as communications and hosting, security and fraud prevention, technical and
                    customer support, tracking and reporting usage of the Service, quality assurance testing, marketing,
                    and
                    other functions. We share information from or about you with these third party providers so that
                    they
                    can perform their services or complete your requests. </p>
                <p className={privacyDivs.paragraph}>We may share aggregate information about our users that does not
                    identify you personally, such as by
                    publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Service and using other data analytics tools.
                    Please
                    note that, while the aggregate data we provide will not identify you personally, in some instances
                    third
                    parties may be able to &ldquo;de-anonymize&rdquo; aggregate data to identify you personally based on
                    additional information they have about you or that they receive from third parties. While we do not
                    intend for third parties to de-anonymize the aggregate data we provide, if you are concerned about
                    potentially being personally identified, you should not use the Service.</p>
                <p className={privacyDivs.paragraph}>In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we might sell
                    or
                    buy subsidiaries, or business
                    units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                    assets
                    but remains subject to applicable data protection laws and the terms in any privacy policy then
                    current
                    at the time the transaction closes. Also, in the unlikely event that we, or substantially all of our
                    assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

                    consumption
                    and are therefore viewable by the
                    public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, comments, and account profile. You may post
                    information, including personal information, on areas of the Service that may be viewed by other
                    users.
                    We urge you to use good judgment. Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with
                    your
                    account, if you include personal information in the Content you post publicly. Do not post any
                    information, including without limitation, personal information, that you do not want other users to
                    know. Many internet connections are public and/or not secure, and other users using that same
                    connection
                    may have access to your information; please make sure that you are using a secure internet
                    connection.</p>

                    Service are only private to the extent
                    that both you and the recipient(s) of your messages keep them private. For example, if you send a
                    message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it. We may access, review, and
                    disclose
                    such messages in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our

                    improve the Service.</p>
                <p className={privacyDivs.paragraph}>You can invite others to join our Service by providing us with
                    their
                    contact information, or by allowing
                    us to access contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to select which
                    individuals you want to invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we will transmit
                    information
                    about your contacts to our servers long enough to process your invitations.</p>

                    opting to receive messages from other

                    from
                    us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages, and
                    share
                    that information with other parties to your messages (for example, to let them know if you have
                    viewed
                    their message). If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order
                    to
                    process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in
                    connection
                    with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We
                    may
                    not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent
                    solicitations,
                    or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. If you send or receive messages through the
                    Service
                    via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the
                    messages
                    were processed. Carriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive. We may also store
                    information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters,
                    emails
                    and other electronic messages, or in person.</p>
                <p className={privacyDivs.paragraph}>If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a
                    reservation or buying, we will collect and

                    address, email, and payment information, as well as any other information you provide, in order to
                    process your transaction, send communications about the transaction to you, and facilitate future
                    transactions. This information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such
                    information with us, for the same purposes. When you submit credit card numbers and other sensitive
                    payment information, that information is encrypted using industry standard technology. If you write
                    reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the
                    fact
                    that you transacted with those businesses in connection with such reviews. For example, if you make
                    a
                    dining reservation through the Service and later write a review about your experience, we may
                    publicly
                    display the fact that you made your reservation through the Service.</p>

                    (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;),
                    California residents have certain
                    rights around the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information.</p>
                <p className={privacyDivs.paragraph}>We do not sell your personal information and will not do so in the
                    future without providing you with

                    know what personal information has
                    been collected about you, and to access that information. You also have the right to request
                    deletion of
                    your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain
